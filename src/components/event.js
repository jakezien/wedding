      <p>The ceremony will be at The Prospect Park Boathouse, at 5:30 PM on October 19, 2019. Drinks, dinner and dancing will follow.</p>
      <p>Dress code is formal. Two notes about what to wear:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Please choose your heels carefully, as the boathouse has cobbled floors.</li>
          <li>Please bring a layer for the October weather, as we hope for an outdoor ceremony.</li>
